# Signal_Analysis
This module consist of lots of functions that I developed over time to filter signals or process earthquake motion records. With time, more functions will be added. It has primarily two submodules Series_Filter and Seismic_Motion  

# Already available great modules for signal processing 

1) *eqsig:* Signal processing for field and experimental data for earthquake engineering (https://pypi.org/project/eqsig/)
